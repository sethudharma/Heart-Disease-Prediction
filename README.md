# 💖 Heart Disease Prediction

This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction** application built with **Machine Learning** and **Django**. It uses a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model to predict the risk of heart disease based on various health metrics.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and **early prediction** can greatly help in effective treatment. This web application allows users to input patient data and get a **prediction** of heart disease risk.

---

## 🎯 Features
- 🔍 **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for accurate heart disease prediction.
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly, interactive interface built with **Django**.
- 🔑 **User Authentication**: Includes secure signup, login, and logout functionality.
- 🕹️ **Dynamic Data Handling**: Enables real-time data input and on-the-fly predictions.
